DC: Doctor Cat!
Doctor Cat! is a light-hearted 2D shooter where you play as a heroic cat doctor fending off waves of viruses in a pixel-art world. This was a one-week solo project created in Unity to sharpen my skills in gameplay programming, UI design, and polish.

How to Play
Move: Arrow Keys or WASD

Shoot: Automatically fires forward

Boost: Hold Left Ctrl for a temporary speed boost

Fast Shooting Buff: Press Spacebar for rapid fire (limited time)

Your mission is simple: survive the virus outbreak as long as you can! Collect power-ups, avoid enemies, and rack up your score.

 Features
Simple, responsive player controls

Speed boost and fast-shooting buffs

Game Over screen with fade transitions

UI with live score, high score, and cooldown indicators

Polished visuals and feedback (flashes, screen shake, SFX)

Mobile-friendly layout and UI scaling

What I Learned
This project helped me practice:

Implementing shooting mechanics and player buffs

Creating animated UI and responsive screen scaling

Using LeanTween for transitions and effects

Managing game state (pause, game over, scoring, HP)

Designing with polish and player feedback in mind
